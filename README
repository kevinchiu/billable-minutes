Billable Minutes

I wrote this so that I could easily extract billable hours from time ranges with minute-level accuracy.

Usage:
	python hourCounter.py ~/Desktop/filename.txt

The file should be in this format:

5:00am - 7:00am, 8:40am - 2:40pm, 4:30pm - 11:59pm
12:00am - 1:10am, 10:37am - 12:54pm, 1:33pm - 7:00pm
3:30pm - 4:00pm, 5:30pm - 6:00pm
10:10am - 3:27pm, 3:34pm - 9:08pm
3:00am - 4:32am, 4:40am - 5:01am, 4:30pm - 5:10pm, 9:44pm - 10:37pm

The output will look like this:

(The number at the bottom is in hours. The other numbers are in minutes.)

5:00am - 7:00am, 8:40am - 2:40pm, 4:30pm - 11:59pm
